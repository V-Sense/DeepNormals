![Example result](images/Carrot.png?raw=true "Example result of the provided model." )
Example result of a deep normal estimation from sketch. Original creation from David Revoy, only non-commercial research usage is allowed.

## Overview

This code provides pre-trained models used in the following research paper:
```
   "Deep Normal Estimation for Automatic Shading of Hand-Drawn Characters"
   Matis Hudon, Rafael Pagés, Mairéad Grogan, Aljosa Smolić
   Geometry Meets Deep Learning ECCV 2018 Workshop
```
Please refer to our [project webpage](https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/research/vfx-animation/deep-normal-estimation-for-automatic-shading-of-hand-drawn-characters/) for more detailed information. 
Please also see our [video of results](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tZ-y0PzV8g&t=3s).

Please note that futher work was made on this project:
```
   "Augmenting Hand-Drawn Art with Global Illumination Effects through Surface Inflation" 
   Matis Hudon and Sebastian Lutz and Rafael Pages and Aljosa Smolic
   CVMP 2019
```
Also a new dataset with ground truth normal maps and depth maps was made available, see the [project webpage](https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/research/augmenting-hand-drawn-art-with-global-illumination-effects-through-surface-inflation/)

## Prerequisites

### With Docker

If you are familiar with docker [this image](https://hub.docker.com/r/matishudon/dockerdeepn/) has everything installed to run the code (please install and run with [nvidia-docker](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)):
	```
	docker pull matishudon/dockerdeepn
	```

This code was tested under ubuntu 16.04.

### Locally

This code was tested under ubuntu 16.04.

- Cuda 9

- python3

- [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
	```
	pip3 install numpy
	```
	
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
	```
	pip3 install -U tensorflow-gpu
	```
- opencv-python 
	```
	pip3 install opencv-python
	```
	
- [tqdm](https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm)
	```
	pip3 install tqdm
	```
	
-  [TFlearn](http://tflearn.org/)
	```
	pip3 install tflearn
	```
	
## Usage
### Generate Normal maps from line drawings

Before using the code, the model has to be downloaded from [here](https://v-sense.scss.tcd.ie/Datasets/DeepNormalsModel.zip) Unzip in the Net/ folder.

#### To Run Locally:

You can test the code with:
```
python3 main.py
```
	
You should see a file Normal_Map.png
You can specify your own images (as in the example folder) with:
```
python3 main.py --lineart_path PathToYourImage --mask_path PathToCorrespondingMask
```
Please see main.py for other commands.

#### To run with docker:
```
sudo nvidia-docker run -v CodeDirectory/:/container/directory/ -it matishudon/dockerdeepn python3 /container/directory/main.py --docker_path /container/directory/
```
Where **CodeDirectory** is the full path of the directory containing main.py.

### Play with the "renderer"
 We also provide a very simple and slow renderer Interactive_Rendering.py please look into the python file for commands. You need to provide an additional color image for this. See the example folder Pepper/.
 <img src="images/Pepper.gif" width="400" height="300" />
 
Artistic image from David Revoy, only non-commercial research usage is allowed.
#### To Run Locally:
```
python3 Interactive_Rendering.py 
```
#### To run with docker:

First run on local machine:
```
xhost +local:docker
```
Then:
```
sudo nvidia-docker run -v CodeDirectory/:/container/directory/ -ti -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix --env QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1 matishudon/dockerdeepn python3 /container/directory/Interactive_Rendering.py --docker_path /container/directory/
```
Where **CodeDirectory** is the full path of the directory containing main.py.
